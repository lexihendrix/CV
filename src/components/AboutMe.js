                        <p>My programming journey started 2020 when I decided to learn coding by myself, and felt like
                            I finally know what I want to do for the rest of my life. So I decided I want a degree - and here we are today.
                            I'm currently in my second and final year at Teknikh√∂gskolan, studying .NET developer.
                            My end goal is to become a fullstack developer - since I love doing both backend (c#) and frontend (react).</p>
                        <p>I am self-driven, problem solving and I work very hard to achieve my goals. Always eager to learn new things,
                            new technologies and work well both within a team or independently. </p>
                        <h3>I need <span>your</span> help</h3>
                        <p> I'm currently looking for a company where can do an internship (February 6th - May 19th 2023)
